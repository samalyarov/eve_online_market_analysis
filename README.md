# Eve Online Market analysis
Repository currently WIP. The status of the project is reflected in this README file and will be updated as the analysis progresses

| Stage | Description | Libraries and tools used |
| :--------------------: | :---------------------: |:---------------------------:|
| [1.Database creation](https://github.com/samalyarov/eve_online_market_analysis/tree/main/postgresql_db)| Stage 1 includes creating a database (developing a proper schema, creating tables and setting up connections in order to fill it an export data later on. At first I deployed the DB in Docker Container, but data storage requirements have forced me to move DB to hard drive to free up RAM. I have used sqlalchemy + DBeaver to set it up and edit. | *postgresql, dbeaver, sqlalchemy, docker* |
| [2.API parsing tool](https://github.com/samalyarov/eve_online_market_analysis/tree/main/api_parser) | Stage 2 includes creating a Python script to constantly parse the official Eve API for market data. Since analysis requires data from several different systems, alongside API limits of 200 items per request the task is done asynchronously. Automation is done via the Windows Task Scheduler and the results are offloaded every hour into a local PostgreSQL database | *pandas, configparser, asyncio, aiohttp, warnings, datetime, tqdm, sqlalchemy* |
| [3.EDA and general analytics]| NOT DONE YET: Stage 3 will include basic EDA and further analysis, targeted at pinpointing potential avenue for making profit. Also - will discover key metrics and important things to display on dashboards for easy access later on.| *&* |
| [4.Dashboard creation]| NOT DONE YET: Stage 4 will include creating dashboards displaying relevant information. Which info to display will be determined during EDA and more detailed analysis in stage 3| *&* |
