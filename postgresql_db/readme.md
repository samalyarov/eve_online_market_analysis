Stage 1 includes creating a database (developing a proper schema, creating tables and setting up connections in order to fill it an export data later on. I've used a Docker Container in order to host the database and sqlalchemy + DBeaver to set it up and edit.

| Files and tables | Description | Libraries and tools used |
| :--------------------: | :---------------------: |:---------------------------:|
| [1.FILE: typeids.csv](link_here) | A file loaded from fuzzworks containings names and ids of all entities in the game. Useful for creating the type IDs table in the DB | *csv, excel* |
